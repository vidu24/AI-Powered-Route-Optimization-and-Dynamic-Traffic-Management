i) Generic Function that'll create the adjacency matrix based on inputs provided in this format [Out_Node, Cost, In_Node].
ii) Make Two functions that'll work on the basic algos. that we intend to work on. That is the Djikstra's and A* along with whatever else we are working on. That is the essence of the program.
iii) Work on the selection of Start Point, End point on a map.
iv) Creation of the inputs and send to matrix.
v) It will work based on the Algorithms written.
vi) overlap the output on the map.

To present the Generic Graph, we can make use of the Graph-simulating libraries and work on that. 
Map things and all, I believe OSM is used, but the extent of it's viability & utility is unknown to me.
